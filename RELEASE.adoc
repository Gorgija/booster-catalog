== Release Instructions

Just tag the repository. There is no need to change master during release. Please keep tags to form `vX` where `v` is always a `v` and `X` is the release number.

IMPORTANT: *Boosters that point to master MUST  be removed.*

```
git checkout -B release
# Remove all YAML files that point to master
git commit -m "Updating to v1"
git tag v1
git push --tags
git checkout master 
git branch -D release
```
